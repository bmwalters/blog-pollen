* fix xml:base (elfeed open relative link from one article to another. make sure this doesn't mess up homepage link)
* implement "recent posts" below posts?
* author-editor separation (feed author separate from post author)
* out-of-source-tree posts directory? (so the ssg [compiler] is separate from the posts programs)
* license

Rationale: important to not distinguish between collections and individual resources (in other words, a collection is a resource) because a resource may become a collection later, e.g. if bootstrapping-bun became a whole series then I would be in a situation where a collection is forced to *not* have a trailing slash to maintain old links / ranking.

https://jamesg.blog/2024/06/06/publish-h-feed

Toolchains:
- Write plain HTML in emacs.
	- Write a tool which inserts header/footer.
	- Write a tool which generates home feed from post HTML docs.
- Write HTML x-expressions in emacs.
- Write Markdown and annotate with pieces (e.g. frontmatter) required for microformats2.

Thing 1: markup/almost-html --> html with microformats2 (or write directly)
Thing 2: page template w/ html include for content
Thing 3: generate home feed
Thing 4: home page template w/ html include for feed
Thing 5: Makefile

Key decision: should the home page iterate over posts or should it include posts output?

Posts:
<include posts>

vs

Posts:
<ul>
{% for post in posts}
	<li>post</li>
{%}
</ul>
